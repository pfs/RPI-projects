# RPI-projects

A repository for Raspberry PI projects

## Naturecam

It's coded terribly and it is expected to rely on a Apache web server installation.
Follow the installation of the web sever @
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/apache.md

Then copy the contents of naturecam to /var/www

A folder www-data to store the photos is needed and some permissions need to be changed for the server to be able to write there
(I have to dig what i did in practice - i don't remember any longer)
